# Odd Even Game
We as kids used to play a game that many people remember as "hand cricket" or "odd even".

How this game is traditionally played is best described [here](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Play-Hand-Cricket/).

This is a version of that game in which you can watch two bots<sup>1</sup> play against each other.

These are shorter games just as an example, sometimes final score could go up in the 100s.
